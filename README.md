# sql_video_game_sales

This is a project using SQL and Tableau to show insights into Video Game Sales data, and then visualize it.
Dataset was created by Jason Holm from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmjason2/videogamedata/data

I began by moving the dataset into a CSV file and uploading it into BigQuery. From here I viewed the schema and looked at a preview of the table.

I made a list of questions for myself to try and answer. Below I include these questions and show the SQL queries I used to answer them.

# What are the top 10 best selling video games?

# Does Blizzard Entertainment have any games in the top 100 best selling list?
